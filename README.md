# Option-Pricing-Using-Black-Scholes-and-Binomial-Tree-Model üéØ
Comparison of Black-Scholes model and the Binomial Tree model in terms of option pricing.


## Overview üìà

This project implements an option pricing model in Python, utilizing financial data to calculate option prices, Greeks, and generate a volatility surface. As a student of Financial Engineering, I built this project to practically implement the Black-Scholes model and Binomial Tree model for option pricing. This project leverages financial and mathematical theories to provide a comprehensive analysis of option pricing strategies using these two models. 


## Features üåü

- **API Integration:** Fetch market data from Alpha Vantage using an API key.
- **Data Processing:** Load and preprocess option data for analysis.
- **Pricing Models:** Calculate option prices using the Black-Scholes and Binomial Tree models.
- **Risk Metrics:** Compute Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho) and Implied Volatility.
- **Visualization:** Generate interactive visualizations of option prices and volatility surfaces using Bokeh.

## Prerequisites üìã

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Obtain an API key from Alpha Vantage and replace `api_key` in `main.py` with your key.


## Usage üöÄ

1. **Run the option pricing model:**

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. The program fetches market data, processes option data, computes prices, Greeks, and implied volatility, and generates interactive visualizations using Bokeh.

## Accomplishments üèÜ

Through this project, we accomplished the following:

1. **Price Calculation:**
   - Calculated option prices using two models:
     - **Black-Scholes Model**
     - **Binomial Tree Model**
   - Observed the differences in option pricing between these models. For example, in our data, the average difference between the Black-Scholes price and the Binomial Tree price was `0.18%`. The difference suggests that, while both models provide very close estimates, they are not identical due to their differing assumptions and methods.

2. **Risk Metrics:**
   - Computed key risk metrics (Greeks) such as Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, and Rho.
   - These metrics help in understanding the sensitivity of the option price to various factors.

3. **Implied Volatility:**
   - Calculated implied volatility for the options, providing insights into the market's expectations of future volatility.

4. **Volatility Surface:**
   - Generated a volatility surface to visualize how implied volatility changes with different strike prices and times to expiry.

### Insights from Pricing Models üí°

- **Black-Scholes Model:**
  - Assumes a constant volatility and provides a closed-form solution for European options.
  - Useful for its simplicity and quick calculations.

- **Binomial Tree Model:**
  - More flexible as it can handle American options and varying volatility.
  - Provides a step-by-step approach to option pricing, which can be more accurate for certain types of options.

### Benefits of Using These Models üìä

- **Black-Scholes Model:**
  - Helps in quickly determining theoretical prices of European options.
  - Useful for initial estimations and comparisons.

- **Binomial Tree Model:**
  - Offers more detailed insights, especially for American options or options with varying conditions.
  - Allows for more accurate pricing under different scenarios.
